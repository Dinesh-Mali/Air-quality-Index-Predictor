# Air-quality-Index-Predictor
In this project we will be building an Air Quality Index Predictor with the help of Machine Learning Models and Auto ML library i.e. TPOT.

# Introduction
Main Aim of this project is to build a model which will predict the Air Quality Index with the help of certain ML algorithms and AutoML.
Later we will deploy the Flask App.

# What is AQI?
Air Quality Index is used by government agencies to communicate to public about the polluted air currently is or 
how polluted it will be in immediate time

When AQI < 100 --> Considered as Satisfactory

When AQI > 100 and < 150 --> Considered as Unhealthy

When AQI > 150 --> Its very Risky.

# TPOT Auto ML Library
It uses a tree-based structure to represent a model pipeline for a predictive modeliing problem, including data preparation and modeling
algorithms and model hyper-parameters.

# Project Flow

1) Data Analysis - Finding out Different relations.

2) Feature Engineering - Processing the data before it feeding to the model.

3) Model Building using ML - Using ML/Dl Algorithms.

4) Model Building using Auto ML.
